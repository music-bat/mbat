## Project Setup

### Requirements
This project contains the source code for backend (e.g. /apps/api) and frontend (e.g. /apps/pwa). Your local setup must meet the following requirements to get the whole ecosystem (api, apps, databases) running on a local machine.

Node.js >=16.0.0 is required to run the backend and frontend code. Docker >= 19.03.0 is required to host local database instances.

### Get Started
Read our [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) to get everything up and running.
If you follow all Getting Started steps, you'll be able to explore the local app, the database or start contributing to this awesome project!

#### Neo4j Dashboard
The Neo4j Dashboard will be available under http://localhost:7474/browser/. Use it to verify database changes you make when working with our neo4j api service.

#### Parse Dashboard
The Parse Dashboard will be available under http://localhost:4040. Use it to manage data in our mongodb. Never connect directly to the mongodb instance to change data!

### Development server

* Run `nx serve-ssr pwa` to start the pwa dev server with ssr. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
* Run `npm run start:cloud` and `nx serve api` to start the api dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test app-name` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e app-name` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).
